# Prediction Market Agent

This repository is a Polymarket-first prediction market trading and research workspace.

Today it has two mature user-facing paths:

- a supervised Polymarket runtime for preview, operator-controlled live runs, and runtime-state recovery
- an offline sports fair-value and replay benchmark toolkit for reproducible research work

It is not an unattended live trading system. The live path is still supervised, fail-closed, and conservative by design.

## Current state, in plain terms

- **Polymarket is the primary mature venue path.** The Polymarket adapter, polling loop, operator CLI, runtime policy loader, and benchmark-to-runtime fair-value flow are the main supported workflow.
- **Kalshi support exists, but it is thinner.** The adapter is useful for interface compatibility and early experiments, but the repo does not claim Polymarket and Kalshi parity.
- **Runtime policy is real and schema-validated.** `engine/runtime_policy.py` loads a versioned JSON policy file and rejects unknown keys or wrong types.
- **Fair-value manifests can carry raw and calibrated values.** Runtime can choose which field to trade from through policy.
- **Risk caps include event-level exposure.** `risk/limits.py` enforces per-market, global, and optional per-event caps when event identity is available.
- **Replay is approximate.** The paper broker models resting orders, reserved capital, fill caps, delay, and slippage, but it is still not a claim of venue-true queue or latency realism.

## What the repo does

- wraps venue APIs behind normalized adapters in `adapters/`
- runs preview, live, and pair-mode polling loops from `scripts/run_agent_loop.py`
- persists safety state, operator pause state, pending recovery items, and recent truth summaries
- exposes operator actions through `scripts/operator_cli.py`
- builds Polymarket-facing fair-value manifests from normalized sportsbook rows
- supports optional benchmark calibration overlays and suite-level edge-ledger artifacts
- snapshots local research datasets and generates chronological walk-forward splits
- runs unit tests in CI and compiles the key runtime and research modules on every push and pull request

## Repository map

- `adapters/` - venue wrappers and normalized types
- `engine/` - polling loop, orchestration, runtime policy, reconciliation, safety state
- `risk/` - exposure caps, cleanup helpers, deterministic risk checks
- `research/` - fair-value builder, calibration, replay, benchmark runner, dataset registry
- `scripts/` - user-facing CLI entrypoints
- `docs/` - onboarding, architecture, runbook, and benchmark docs
- `tests/` - unit coverage for runtime policy, risk, replay, benchmark, and CLI behavior
- `upstreams/` - pinned references and dependency sources, not the product core

## Install

From the repo root:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

For the reproducible offline benchmark path:

```bash
pip install -e ".[research]"
```

For venue-specific runtime integrations:

```bash
pip install -e ".[polymarket]"
pip install -e ".[kalshi]"
```

The package installs these console entrypoints from `pyproject.toml`:

- `run-agent-loop`
- `operator-cli`
- `build-sports-fair-values`
- `refresh-sports-fair-values`
- `run-sports-benchmark`
- `run-sports-benchmark-suite`
- `prediction-market-sports-benchmark`
- `prediction-market-sports-benchmark-suite`

## Fast start paths

### 1. Run the offline benchmark first

```bash
make reproduce

# or run the suite command directly
prediction-market-sports-benchmark --fixture sports_benchmark_tiny.json
prediction-market-sports-benchmark-suite --output-dir runtime/benchmark-suite
```

Containerized reproduction path:

```bash
docker build -t polymarket-prediction-agent:v0.1.0 .
docker run --rm polymarket-prediction-agent:v0.1.0
```

Packaged fixtures live in `research/fixtures/`:

- `sports_benchmark_tiny.json`
- `sports_benchmark_best_line.json`
- `sports_benchmark_round_trip.json`

The suite writes:

- `benchmark_suite_summary.json`
- `benchmark_suite_summary.md`
- `benchmark_suite_edge_ledger.json`
- `cases/<case-name>.json`

There is also a checked-in example suite output under `runtime/benchmark-suite-e2e-check/`.

### 2. Build a Polymarket fair-value manifest

```bash
python3 scripts/export_polymarket_markets.py --output runtime/polymarket_markets.json --limit 200
python3 scripts/fetch_the_odds_api_rows.py --sport-key basketball_nba --event-map-file runtime/odds_event_map.json --output runtime/sportsbook_odds.json
python3 scripts/build_sports_fair_values.py --input runtime/sportsbook_odds.json --markets-file runtime/polymarket_markets.json --output runtime/fair_values.json --book-aggregation best-line --devig-method multiplicative --max-age-seconds 900
```

The emitted manifest can include:

- `fair_value`
- optional `calibrated_fair_value`
- `condition_id`
- `event_key`
- sport metadata such as `sport`, `series`, `game_id`, and `sports_market_type`

### 3. Run one supervised Polymarket preview cycle

```bash
run-agent-loop \
  --venue polymarket \
  --mode preview \
  --fair-values-file runtime/fair_values.json \
  --max-cycles 1
```

You can also run pair ranking modes:

- `--mode pair-preview`
- `--mode pair-run`

### 4. Put trading thresholds in a runtime policy file

```bash
run-agent-loop \
  --venue polymarket \
  --mode preview \
  --fair-values-file runtime/fair_values.json \
  --policy-file runtime/policy.json
```

The policy file is the source of truth for:

- fair-value field selection, `raw` or `calibrated`
- base quantity and edge threshold
- shared risk limits, including `max_contracts_per_event`
- ranker and pair-ranker filters
- deterministic execution gate settings
- engine timing and overlay recovery settings
- lifecycle cleanup policy
- Polymarket depth admission settings

### 5. Inspect runtime state

```bash
operator-cli status --state-file runtime/safety-state.json
operator-cli status --state-file runtime/safety-state.json --journal runtime/events.jsonl
```

## Runtime safety model

The supervised runtime is built to fail closed.

- New trading can be blocked by pause, halt, hold-new-orders, incomplete truth, pending recovery work, or policy-gate rejection.
- Polymarket has a phase-1 live-state overlay for open-order and fill freshness, but REST truth is still the final source for balances, positions, and reconciliation.
- The operator CLI exposes `pause`, `unpause`, `hold-new-orders`, `clear-hold-new-orders`, `force-refresh`, `resume`, `cancel-all`, and `cancel-stale`.

This is meant for supervised operation, not for fire-and-forget deployment.

## Benchmark and research artifacts

The benchmark stack is useful when you want a reproducible offline slice of the repo.

- `research/benchmark_cli.py` runs a single case
- `research/benchmark_suite_cli.py` runs a multi-case suite
- `research/benchmark_runner.py` reports raw and calibrated forecast metrics when calibration samples are present
- `research/benchmark_suite.py` writes a suite-level edge ledger for later attribution work
- `research/datasets.py` snapshots row datasets or benchmark cases and generates walk-forward splits

## CI

`.github/workflows/python-ci.yml` currently does three things on pushes and pull requests:

- installs the package
- compiles the key runtime and research modules with `py_compile`
- runs `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"`

## Citation and release metadata

- `CITATION.cff` at the repo root provides software citation metadata for GitHub's **Cite this repository** surface.
- `v0.1.0` is the first intended reproducible software release tag for this benchmark toolkit.
- Zenodo DOI minting still requires Zenodo-side GitHub linking and repository enablement in addition to the repo metadata in this project.
